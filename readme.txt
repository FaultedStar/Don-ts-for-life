I	will	be	looking	for	three	pdf	files	in	the	Phoenix	drive	on	Friday	along	
with	a	short	README.txt	(roughly	100	word)	explanation	of	the	bookâ€™s	
concept,	current	state,	and	expected	technical	challenges	in	automating.
Also	please	include	the	expected	printing	parameters:	paper	size,	
binding,	and	any	paper	preferences.
