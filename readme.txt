My book is a bad advice book, based 2 of the books in my tiny book collection. 
The first is "Don'ts for Wives". From this book I am taking the size and cover styling, as well as the advice styling. This means in my book I will be telling people "helpful" things not to do. This will come from complex grammers created with tracery, as well as blunt advice such as "dont stick your hand in a bike wheel."
I am taking the internal styling and the calm/ridiculous tone from the little book of calm. This book has small images that accompany the advice, that are also layered transparently in the background. I plan on mimicing this because I think its just a funny design choice. 
 This design in whole is a critical piece on how old fashioned and unhelpful it is to phrase advice in a negative manner (to NOT do things) paired with the redicults idea that if you tell someone to just appreciate how nice helicopters look, perhaps that could cure their bad mood.

For the images I plan on using the quick,draw database. I have yet to figure that out, but will be using the below resources to figure it out. 
I think getting the indesign pipeline automating will be somewhat difficut when it comes to making sure they layout looks consistant. That and getting SVG's into indesign.
